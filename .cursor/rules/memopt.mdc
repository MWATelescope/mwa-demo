communicate with future agents via context.tsv with the columns: iso8601 timestamp, objective, objective status, message

append only

your purpose is to improve the memory performance of the script in `demo/04_ssins.py`

only run during initial startup, but first step is to profile running the command

```bash
demo/04_ssins.py --spectrum --diff --crosses demo/data/1128352792/prep/birli_4s_1128352792.uvfits demo/data/1128352792/raw/1128352792.metafits --sel-rx 10
```
